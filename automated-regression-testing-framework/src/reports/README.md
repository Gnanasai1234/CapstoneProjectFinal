# This file contains documentation on how to access and interpret the test reports generated by the testing framework.

## Test Reports Overview

The automated regression testing framework generates detailed reports after each test run. These reports provide insights into the test execution results, including passed, failed, and skipped tests.

## Accessing Reports

Reports are generated in the `reports` directory after the test execution. You can find the latest report files named with timestamps for easy identification.

## Report Structure

Each report typically includes the following sections:

- **Summary**: A brief overview of the total number of tests run, along with counts of passed, failed, and skipped tests.
- **Detailed Results**: A breakdown of each test case, including the test name, execution time, and status (pass/fail).
- **Error Logs**: For failed tests, detailed error messages and stack traces will be provided to help diagnose issues.

## Interpreting Results

- **Passed Tests**: Indicate that the functionality is working as expected.
- **Failed Tests**: Require immediate attention. Review the error logs to identify the cause of failure.
- **Skipped Tests**: These tests were not executed, often due to conditions not being met. Review the test setup to understand why.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review test reports to ensure the application remains stable.
- Integrate report generation into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the process.
- Use the insights from the reports to improve test coverage and application quality.
